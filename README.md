# Home_Sales

In this challenge, I used my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. 

Then I used Spark to create temporary views, partitioned the data, cached and uncached a temporary table, and verified that the table has been uncached.

The data is from an AWS S3 bucket and I pulled it in via pyspark.
